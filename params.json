  "body": "### About\r\nI am currently an [Einstein Fellow](http://cxc.harvard.edu/fellows/) at [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu)'s [Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences](cass.ucsd.edu). Prior to that I was the Henry Skynner Junior Research Fellow in Astrophysics at [Balliol College](https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/), [Oxford](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/astrophysics). I am also the Deputy Project Scientist for [Galaxy Zoo](https://www.galaxyzoo.org/) and Principal Investigator of [Galaxy Zoo Bar Lengths](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/vrooje/galaxy-zoo-bar-lengths) and [The Planetary Response Network](planetaryresponsenetwork.com). My primary research focus is on the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. I make extensive use of multi-wavelength data, including from the [Hubble Space Telescope](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/) and the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](http://www.sdss.org/). I use parametric methods such as [GALFIT](http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html) to analyze galaxy light profiles and separate galaxies from their central active galactic nuclei (AGN), and have created my own method to determine bolometric luminosities of obscured AGN. I study AGN across many orders of magnitude in luminosity and mass, and I am particularly interested in the merger-AGN connection. This includes the possible lack of it: my recent work has found that merger-free processes can grow supermassive black holes to substantial masses, hosted in pure disk galaxies of proportionally large masses. \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nI can be reached at the following address:\r\n\r\nBrooke Simmons  \r\nUC San Diego, CASS 0424  \r\n9500 Gilman Drive  \r\nLa Jolla, CA 92093  \r\nUSA  \r\n+1 858 822 4463\r\n\r\n[GitHub](https://github.com/vrooje) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vrooje)  \r\nEmail: use `bdsimmons` for the first bit, and for the domain bit it's `ucsd.edu`.\r\n ",
