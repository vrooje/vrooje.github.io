<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h3>

<p>I am currently an <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/fellows/">Einstein Fellow</a> at <a href="http://ucsd.edu">UC San Diego</a>'s <a href="cass.ucsd.edu">Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences</a>. Prior to that I was the Henry Skynner Junior Research Fellow in Astrophysics at <a href="https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/">Balliol College</a>, <a href="http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/astrophysics">Oxford</a>. I am also the Deputy Project Scientist for <a href="https://www.galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a> and Principal Investigator of <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/vrooje/galaxy-zoo-bar-lengths">Galaxy Zoo Bar Lengths</a> and <a href="planetaryresponsenetwork.com">The Planetary Response Network</a>. My primary research focus is on the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. I make extensive use of multi-wavelength data, including from the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>. I use parametric methods such as <a href="http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html">GALFIT</a> to analyze galaxy light profiles and separate galaxies from their central active galactic nuclei (AGN), and have created my own method to determine bolometric luminosities of obscured AGN. I study AGN across many orders of magnitude in luminosity and mass, and I am particularly interested in the merger-AGN connection. This includes the possible lack of it: my recent work has found that merger-free processes can grow supermassive black holes to substantial masses, hosted in pure disk galaxies of proportionally large masses. </p>

<p>As an undergraduate, I took one art class per term. Walking between studio time and physics problem sessions during the first semester was slightly painful at first: switching between artistic and analytical modes wasn't always easy. Eventually I learned to go back and forth at will.</p>

<p>When I discovered ceramics, the balance felt complete. Pottery is a process blending physics, chemistry, mathematics and design. Plus, it's fun to get your hands dirty. It's even more fun to pour tea from a pot you transformed from nothing but a ball of moist earth into a functional, durable and hopefully beautiful vessel.</p>

<p>Finding creative solutions to challenging problems is a fundamental part of astrophysics. The connection between ceramics and black holes may not be immediately apparent, but sometimes non-obvious connections are the key to unraveling a research puzzle. So I try to carve out regular (if not frequent) time to cultivate my hobby.</p>
