<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h3>

<p>I am currently a Reader in Physics at <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/">Lancaster University</a>. Prior to coming to Lancaster I was an <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/fellows/">Einstein Fellow</a> at <a href="http://ucsd.edu">UC San Diego</a>'s <a href="cass.ucsd.edu">Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences</a> and the Henry Skynner Junior Research Fellow in Astrophysics at <a href="https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/">Balliol College</a>, <a href="http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/astrophysics">Oxford</a>, having earned my PhD from <a href="https://astronomy.yale.edu/">Yale</a> working with <a href="https://astronomy.yale.edu/people/meg-urry">Meg Urry</a>.</p>

<p>I am also the Deputy PI for <a href="https://www.galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a> and Principal Investigator of <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/vrooje/galaxy-zoo-bar-lengths">Galaxy Zoo Bar Lengths</a> and <a href="planetaryresponsenetwork.com">The Planetary Response Network</a>. As part of the Zooniverse team and the founder of the Zooniverse Analysis and Zooniverse Transient Groups, I have helped design, run, and produce science from citizen science projects, and have done research into the practice of crowdsourcing and its use in change detection and human-machine classification.</p>

<p>My astrophysical research focuses on galaxy evolution, including the merger-free (sometimes called "secular") growth of galaxies and quenching of star-formation processes, and the co-evolution of supermassive black holes with their host galaxies. I make extensive use of multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic data, including from the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>. In combination with quantitative visual morphologies from Galaxy Zoo, I use parametric methods such as <a href="http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html">GALFIT</a> to analyze galaxy light profiles and separate galaxies from their central active galactic nuclei (AGN), and have created my own method to determine bolometric luminosities of obscured AGN.</P>

<P>I study galaxies and AGN across many orders of magnitude in luminosity and mass, and I am particularly interested in the merger-AGN connection. This includes the possible lack of it: my recent work has found that merger-free processes can grow supermassive black holes to substantial masses, hosted in pure disk galaxies of proportionally large masses. Merger-free processes appear to be at least as important as merger-driven processes in growing both galaxies and black holes, including in the early Universe, but there is much work to be done to disentangle this complex web of processes and understand fundamental causes. My work aims to answer these open questions by combining observation and theory, using some of the largest data sets astronomers now have and will have in the future.</p>

TITLE="From Simmons et al. 2013: these galaxies have 'full-grown' black holes for their galaxies, but no bulges at all. The black hole and galaxy growth must have happened due to secular (calm, internal) galaxy evolution."><BR CLEAR=ALL>Bulgeless and strongly disk-dominated galaxies hosting growing black holes are excellent means to study secular co-evolution of black holes and galaxies in isolation from merger-driven processes. In these galaxy images, signatures of the actively growing black holes are visible as unresolved points of light in the galaxy nuclei. (<A HREF="http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/ui/abs/2013MNRAS.429.2199S" TITLE="MNRAS 2013, 429, 2199, Galaxy Zoo: bulgeless galaxies with growing black holes" TARGET="_blank">Simmons et al. 2013</A>; <A HREF="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017MNRAS.470.1559S/abstract" TARGET="_blank" TITLE="Supermassive black holes in disk-dominated galaxies outgrow their bulges and co-evolve with their host galaxies">Simmons, Smethurst &amp; Lintott 2017</A>)</P>

<!-- <P>The structural shape of galaxies is evident in well-resolved images, and these teach us interesting things about the process of galaxy evolution. I make use of quantitative visual morphologies, often in combination with other morphological analyses, to study galaxy populations. For example, by studying the signatures of gravitational instabilities in disk galaxies, I and collaborators discovered that the process of creating very thin disks of stars in galaxies began about 8 billion years ago. For at least 3 billion years prior to this, disk galaxies were in a relatively stable, thicker state (<A HREF="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014MNRAS.445.3466S/abstract" TITLE="MNRAS 2014, 445, 3466, Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS barred discs and bar fractions" TARGET="_blank">Simmons et al. 2014</A>, <A HREF="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014MNRAS.438.2882M/abstract" TITLE="MNRAS 2014, 438, 2882, Galaxy Zoo: an independent look at the evolution of the bar fraction over the last eight billion years from HST-COSMOS" TARGET="_blank">Melvin et al. 2014</A>). I also study the way star formation proceeds in galaxy populations, in particular the way galaxies transition from blue to red. This may relate to AGN activity.</P> -->

<p>Pottery is a process blending physics, chemistry, mathematics and design. Plus, it's fun to get your hands dirty. It's even more fun to pour tea from a pot you transformed from nothing but a ball of moist earth into a functional, durable and hopefully beautiful vessel.</p>

<p>Finding creative solutions to challenging problems is a fundamental part of astrophysics. The connection between ceramics and black holes may not be immediately apparent, but sometimes non-obvious connections are the key to unraveling a research puzzle. So I try to carve out regular (if not frequent) time to cultivate my hobby.</p>
